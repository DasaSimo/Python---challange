# Python-Challenge
These are two examples from real world situation where Python can be used for the data analysis. For both situation the datasets were provided in CSV format, then the script - main.py was created to run for each analysis. Finally, the results were printed to the terminal and to the text file.

## PyBank
The Python script was used for analyzing the financial records, provided as a dataset in CSV format, as in the Resources folder. Only "Date" and "Profit/Losses" information were recorded as accounting information. 
Logic is implemented in main.py to calculate the total number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of profit/losses, average of changes in profit/losses and greatest increase and decrease in profits as the amount with a date.

## PyPoll
The analyzed data is from an election, where dataset is composed from information about “Voter ID”, “County” and “Candidate”, in CSV format. The script was created to analyze and calculate the total number of votes cast. For complete list of candidates, the percentage of votes received as well as total number of votes was calculated and based on this information the winner of the election was determined.
